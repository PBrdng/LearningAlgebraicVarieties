# Learning Algebraic Varieties
Welcome to the LearningAlgebraicVarieties package from the article [Learning Algebraic Varieties from Samples](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13163-018-0273-6.pdf) by P. Breiding, S. Kalisnik, B. Sturmfels and M. Weinstein.

To install the package, open a new `Julia` session and type
```julia
]add https://github.com/PBrdng/LearningAlgebraicVarieties.git
```
After the installation is completed the command
```julia
using LearningAlgebraicVarieties
```
loads all the functions into the current session.

All functions accept m data points in ℝ^n or ℙ^(n-1) as an m×n matrix Ω; i.e., as arrays.

We provide some datasets in the [JLD2](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD2.jl.git) data format. Download the `datasets.jld2` from this repository, navigate to its folder and use
```julia
using JLD2 # add this packages with ]add JLD2
@load "datasets.jld2"
```
Now, your session should contain a dictionary with name `data` containing some datasets.

## How to make dimension diagrams
Here is an example:
```julia
DimensionDiagrams(Ω, true)
```
plots the all dimension diagrams for the data in projective space. On the other hand,
```julia
DimensionDiagrams(Ω, false, diagrams = [:CorrSum, :BoxCounting], eps_ticks = 10)
```
plots the dimension diagrams CorrSum and BoxCounting for data in euclidean space. The estimates are computed for 10 values of ϵ between 0 and 1.

The complete syntax of the ``DimensionDiagrams`` function is as follows.
```julia
DimensionDiagrams(
    Ω::Array{T,2},
    projective::Bool;
    diagrams  = [:CorrSum, :BoxCounting, :NPCA, :MLE, :ANOVA, :PHCurve],
    eps_ticks = 25,
    fontsize = 16,
    lw = 4
    ) where {T <: Number}
```
Here:
* `Ω` is a matrix whose columns are the data points.
* `projective = false`: makes diagrams in euclidean space.
* `projective = true`: makes diagrams in projective space.
There are some optional arguments.
* `methods`: lists the dimension estimators to be plotted.
* `eps_ticks = k`: puts k evenly spaced ϵ into [0,1]. At those ϵs the dimensions are computed.
* `fontsize`: sets the font size of the axes.
* `lw`: sets the line width.


## How to compute multivariate Vandermonde matrices
Here is an example.
```julia
MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(Ω, 2, true)
```
computes the multivariate Vandermonde matrix for the sample Ω and all monomials of degree  2. The `true` value determines homogeneous equations. On the other hand, the Vandermonde matrix with all monomials of degree at most 2 is computed by
```julia
MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(Ω, 2, false)
```
It is also possible to define the exponents involved. For example,
```julia
exponents = [[1,0,0], [1,1,1]]
MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(Ω, exponents)
```
computes the multivariate Vandermonde matrix for Ω ⊂ ℝ^3 and the monomials `x_1` and `x_1 x_2 x_3`.

Here is the full syntax
```julia
MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(Ω::Array{T},
                              d::Int64,
                              homogeneous_equations::Bool)

MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(data::Array{T},
                              exponents::Vector)
```
where
* `Ω` is a matrix whose colums are the data.
* `d` is the degree of the monomials.
* `homogeneous_equations = true` restricts the space of monomials to monomials of degree d.
* `homogeneous_equations = false` computes all monomials of degree at most d.
* `exponents` is an array of exponents vectors.

## How to find equations
Here is an example.
```julia
FindEquations(Ω, :with_svd, 2, true)
```
finds homogeneous equations of degree 2 using SVD to compute the kernel of the Vandermonde matrix, while
```julia
FindEquations(Ω, :with_qr, 3, false)
```
finds all polynomials of degree at most 3 and uses QR to compute the kernel of the Vandermonde matrix.

To find all equations with support `x_1 x_2` and `x_1^2` using the reduced row echelon form to compute the kernel, type
```julia
exponents = [[1,1], [2,0]]
FindEquations(Ω, :with_rref, exponents)
```

A multivariate Vandermonde matrix  may be passed to FindEquations:
```julia
M = MultivariateVandermondeMatrix(Ω, 2, false)
FindEquations(M, :with_svd, τ)
```
where τ is a tolerance value.


The full syntax of ``FindEquations`` is as follows.
```julia
FindEquations(Ω::Array{T,2},
              alg::Symbol,
              d::Int64,
              homogeneous_equations::Bool)
              where  {T<:Number}

FindEquations(Ω::Array{T,2},
              alg::Symbol,
              exponents::Array{Array{Int64,1},1})
              where  {T<:Number}

FindEquations(M::MultivariateVandermondeMatrix,
              alg::Symbol,
              τ::Float64)
```
Here:
* `Ω` is a matrix whose colums are the data points.
* `alg` is the algorithm that should be used (one of `:with_svd`, `:with_qr`, `:with_rref`).
* `d` is the degree of the equations.
* `homogeneous_equations = true` restricts the search space to homogeneous polynomials.
* `homogeneous_equations = false` computes all polynomials of degree at most d.
* `exponents` is an array of exponent vectors.
* `τ` is the tolerance value.


## Distances
Computing distances is a key aspect in both dimension estimation and persistent homology. Here are the functions with which we compute distances.

To compute the scaled Fubini Study distances between the data points in Ω type
```julia
ScaledEuclidean(Ω)
```

On the other hand,to compute the scaled Fubini Study distances between the data points in Ω type
```julia
ScaledFubiniStudy(Ω)
```
Finally, the ellipsoid-driven complex is encoded in a distance matrix. It is computed by typing
```julia
EllipsoidDistances(Ω, f, λ)
```
where `f` is a vector of polynomials of the type provided by [DynamicPolynomials.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAlgebra/DynamicPolynomials.jl) and λ sets the ratio between the principal axes of the ellipsoids
